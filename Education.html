                                <p class="text-gray-300">My time at NIT Puducherry has been a highly practical learning experience. The coursework has given me a strong understanding of core mechanical subjects such as vehicle design, dynamics, and fluid mechanics. Alongside theory, I have gained hands-on exposure to industry-standard tools, using NX CAD for design and ANSYS for simulation and analysis. This practical approach has made classroom concepts more relevant and has strengthened my ability to apply them to real engineering challenges.</p>
                                <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">What makes my journey here distinctive is my Minor in Electric Vehicle Technology. This specialization introduced me to emerging areas like battery systems, hybrid powertrains, and electric motors, aligning directly with the future of the automotive industry. The combination of mechanical engineering fundamentals and EV expertise has prepared me with the skills and confidence to contribute to designing and developing the next generation of efficient and powerful vehicles.</p>
